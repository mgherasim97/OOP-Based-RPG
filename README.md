# OOP-Based-RPG

I used OOP, enheritance, templates, operator overloading and various STL libraries such as map, vector or set
A game where a multitude of players of various classes move randomly (or to the center of the map if desired) and take on each other. 

There are various mechanics such as item power ups, random dodge chances or a certain type of player (the blob) being 
able to merge with another to increase in stats.
